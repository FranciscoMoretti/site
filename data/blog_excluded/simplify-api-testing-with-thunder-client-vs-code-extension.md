## Introduction

As a junior web developer, diving into API testing can be intimidating. However, with the right tools, the process can be streamlined and more approachable. In this blog post, we'll explore Thunder Client, a powerful and user-friendly REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code. Let's take a closer look at how Thunder Client can simplify your API testing workflow and improve your development experience.

## Installation

Follow one of these options to install it:

- Search for `rangav.vscode-thunder-client` in VS Code Extensions panel and hit install.
- [Install via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace →](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client).

### Keyboard shortcut

The extension uses `ctrl+shift+r` as the keyboard shortcut, which is the reserved VS Code shortcut for refactor. The extension will override it. To preserve the refactor shortcut, open the shortcut settings by pressing `ctrl+shift+p` and selecting `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`. Then add this as a key binding:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r",
  "command": "editor.action.refactor"
}
```
