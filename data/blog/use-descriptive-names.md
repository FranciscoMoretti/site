## Usage

### 📝 Guideline

**Use Descriptive Names**: Choose names that make the code more meaningful and express the purpose or functionality.

A good practice in clean code development is to use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other code entities. By opting for meaningful names, you enhance the readability and maintainability of your codebase. Descriptive names provide clarity and convey the intent of the code, allowing other developers to understand your code quickly.

### 🛠️ How to Apply

- Choose wisely: Choose meaningful names that accurately describe the purpose, role, or behavior of the code entity. 📌
- Avoid ambiguity: Avoid using ambiguous or generic names that can lead to confusion. Be specific and precise in your naming choices. 🧐
- Use Conventions: Use common programming conventions and naming patterns to make your code more consistent and familiar to other developers. 🔄
- Consider Context: Consider the context and scope of the code entity when selecting a name. Names should reflect their purpose within the broader system. 🌍

## Pros and Cons

### 👍 Pros

- **Improved Readability**: Descriptive names make the code more understandable and reduce the cognitive load when reading and maintaining code. 📖
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear and expressive names help in code maintenance by facilitating future modifications or bug fixes. 🛠️
- **Better Collaboration**: Meaningful names improve collaboration among team members, enabling effective communication and shared understanding. 👥

### 👎 Cons

- **Increased Name Length**: Descriptive names may result in longer identifier lengths, which can impact code size and potentially increase typing effort. 📏
- **Subjective Naming**: Choosing descriptive names involves some subjectivity, which may lead to different interpretations among developers. 🤔

## Examples

### ❌ Bad

```typescript
// Bad example: Poorly named function and variables
function calc(l: number, w: number): number {
  const r = l * w
  return r
}
```

### ✅ Good

```typescript
// Good example: Descriptive function and variable names
function calculateRectangleArea(length: number, width: number): number {
  const area = length * width
  return area
}
```
