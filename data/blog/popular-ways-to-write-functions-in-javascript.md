## What is Function Syntax? 📝

JavaScript offers various ways to define functions, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are the most commonly used methods:

## Function Declaration
Function Declaration provides a straightforward syntax for defining functions.

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
    // Function body
    return expression
}
```
**Usage**: Perfect for defining functions that need to be hoisted, meaning they can be called before they are declared.

## Function Expression
Function Expression assigns a function to a variable.

```javascript
var functionName = function(parameters) {
    // Function body
    return expression
};
```
**Usage**: Useful for anonymous functions or when you want to assign a function to a variable.

## Arrow Function (ES6)
Arrow Function introduces a concise syntax.

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => {
    // Function body
    return expression
};
```
**Usage**: Provides a concise syntax, especially handy for short, one-liner functions. It also maintains the lexical `this`, making it particularly useful for callbacks and event handlers.

## Arrow Function with Implicit Return (ES6)
Arrow Function with Implicit Return offers a shorthand for arrow functions. This example returns the expression.

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => expression;
```
**Usage**: Offers a shorthand for arrow functions when the function body consists of a single expression.
