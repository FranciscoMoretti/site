Tools are software applications or programs designed to assist developers in various aspects of web development. They automate repetitive tasks, enhance productivity, and offer advanced features that simplify coding challenges. 

Web development tools come in different forms, such as IDEs, version control systems, and browser developer tools. These tools provide a supportive environment for writing, testing, debugging, and deploying web applications. By leveraging the right tools, you can save time, improve code quality, and stay up to date with the latest development practices.

## Essential Web Development Tools
