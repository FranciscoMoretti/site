I teach developers how to create better software and deliver it faster with code tips and productivity tools.

In 2017, I graduated from college with an Electronics Engineering degree. That year I created my first software project and I liked it more than all the circuits I ever built.

A few months later, I was doing software development full-time. I solved problems but every pull request took a long time because I wasn't fast and I didn't know how to write clean code.

Then I discovered the world of productivity and good programming practices. I quickly became one of the most prolific contributors at my company.

With these techniques, I enhanced our codebase design for an agile development experience. And even better, I helped my teammates improve their coding skills.

Today, I help people (just like you!) grow their programming skills with code clarity and development efficiency.

At the moment, I'm working with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. I use JavaScript to illustrate some examples.
