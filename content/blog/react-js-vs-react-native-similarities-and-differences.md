## Introduction

Are you ready to explore a comparison between React.js and React Native, two of the most popular technologies in the web and mobile development? Let's check their commonalities, differences, and some guidance on when to use each.

## Commonalities between React JS and React Native

Both React JS and React Native, developed by Facebook, share a common core, emphasizing components, state management, and rendering. Familiarity with React JS eases the transition to React Native, promoting component reusability and modularity. The use of JSX, state, props, and React Hooks further reinforces their similarities.


| Feature                   | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Open-Source Libraries** | Both React JS and React Native are open-source libraries developed by Facebook.                       |
| **React Core**            | They share the same React core, encompassing algorithms for handling state, components, and rendering. |
| **Components**            | Embrace the concept of components, fostering reusability and modularity.                               |
| **JSX Usage**             | Utilize JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing HTML-like code within JavaScript.             |
| **State and Props**       | Manage state and props in a similar fashion, promoting consistency between the two libraries.          |
| **React Hooks**           | Support React Hooks for simplified component logic, encouraging the use of functional components.     |




## Differences between React JS and React Native

While React JS employs standard HTML elements, React Native uses specific components mapped to native UI elements. The differences extend to styling, with React JS relying on standard CSS, while React Native supports a subset, only Flexbox layout. Navigation is another difference, with React JS using URL-based navigation and React Native suggesting React Navigation.

| Key Distinctions                 | React.js                       | React Native                        |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Rendering Components**         | HTML and CSS                   | Native UI components on platforms  |
| **Styling**                      | Standard CSS                   | Subset of CSS, only Flexbox layout     |
| **Navigation**                   | URL-based with React Router    | React Navigation for mobile views  |
| **Testing Environment**          | Directly in the browser         | Requires Expo, simulators, SDKs    |


## What to do when you need React.js and React Native?

But what if you need both a website and an app? Many times, the optimal solution involves sharing code between React Native and React JS. A mono repository setup facilitates code and logic sharing across applications.

## Which to Learn First?

For beginners, starting with React JS is recommended. The fundamentals of React JS seamlessly apply to React Native, with the React JS tutorial serving as an excellent educational resource. Mastering React JS creates a solid foundation for getting into React Native's mobile development.

In conclusion, understanding the differences between React.js and React Native empowers developers to make informed decisions based on project requirements. Start with React JS, grasp the basics, and seamlessly transition into the mobile development arena with React Native.
