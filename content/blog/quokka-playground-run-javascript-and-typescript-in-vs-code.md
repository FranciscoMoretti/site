## Introduction
When working on a large project, it's often necessary to test specific code snippets in isolation. In this blog post, we explore the Quokka extension for Visual Studio Code, a solution that simplifies code testing and learning in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## What is Quokka Playground? ðŸš€
The Quokka extension provides a seamless testing experience within Visual Studio Code. With Quokka, you can easily create new files for trying out code using the command palette. As you type, Quokka automatically runs and displays the output of each `console.log` line, allowing you to observe results in real-time.

Quokka isn't limited to JavaScript; it also supports TypeScript, making it a versatile tool for various web development scenarios.

## Installation 
Follow one of these options to install it.
-  Search for `WallabyJs.quokka-vscode` in VS Code Extensions panel and hit install.
- [Install via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace â†’](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode).

## Enhance Your Learning Journey ðŸ“š

Quokka is an excellent companion for practicing algorithms and enhancing your overall learning experience. As you write code, Quokka provides visual cues by displaying red or green squares on the left side of each line, indicating the presence or absence of errors.

Furthermore, Quokka allows you to import and test node modules that are already a part of your project, expanding its usefulness beyond isolated code snippets.

## How Quokka Enhances JavaScript Development ðŸ§ª
Quokka introduces a practical approach to JavaScript development by providing instant code evaluation, conveniently displaying the output alongside your code. This eliminates the need to switch between files or browsers for testing, streamlining your workflow.

You can activate Quokka on a per-file basis or selectively evaluate specific code sections. This flexibility empowers you to experiment and test parts of your code without disrupting the entire project.

```typescript
// Sample JavaScript code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

add(2, 3); // Output: 5
```


## Features at a Glance ðŸ§©

Quokka comes with a range of features designed to enhance your development workflow.

### Live Feedback for JS and TS

Quokka provides real-time execution feedback within the editor. You can open a new Quokka file or restart Quokka on an existing file using convenient keyboard shortcuts 
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K  J` for JavaScript
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K  T` for TypeScript

The execution output is displayed in the Quokka Console, accessible through the "Show Output" command or the status bar indicator.
