# Prettier Code Formatter VS Code Extension - A Time-Saving Marvel 🌟

Are you tired of spending countless minutes tweaking the formatting of your code? Do you wish there was a magical tool that could take care of all the tedious spacing, line breaks, and quote choices for you? In this blog post, we'll dive into the wonderful world of the Prettier Code Formatter VS Code extension and discover how it can transform your coding experience. 💻✨

## What is Prettier? 🧐 

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)  is an opinionated code formatter that helps you maintain consistent code styling in your projects. By automatically applying a set of predefined formatting rules, Prettier saves you from the hassle of manual adjustments, freeing up your time to focus on what truly matters: creating awesome websites.

## Installation
Simply search for `esbenp.prettier-vscode` in VS Code Extensions panel and hit install. Or **[Install via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace →](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)**.

**Note:** if Prettier is not installed in your project you can install it by following the [official installation instructions](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html).

### Setting Prettier as the Default Formatter
To make sure that Prettier is used instead of any other code formatter extensions you might have, set it as the default formatter in your VS Code settings. Simply add the following code snippet to your VS Code settings file:

```json settings.json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```


## The VS Code Extension Superpower 🚀

If you're a Visual Studio Code enthusiast like me, you're in the right place! The Prettier Code Formatter extension integrates seamlessly with VS Code, allowing you to unleash the full power of Prettier right within your favorite code editor. 🎉

With the Prettier extension enabled, you can effortlessly format your code with a simple keyboard shortcut or even set it up to format your code automatically on save. Yes, you heard that right! The `formatOnSave` option combined with Prettier will work its magic every time you hit that save button. 🪄✨

### Using Format-On-Save
Format-On-Save is a powerful feature that allows you to automatically format your code every time you save your file. This feature respects the `editor.formatOnSave` setting, which can be turned on for every language compatible with Prettier using:

```json settings.json
{
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
}
```

## The Need for Speed ⚡

As a developer, time is of the essence. The faster you can produce clean and readable code, the more efficient and productive you become. And that's why Prettier is our friend! 😎

Say goodbay to manually adjusting spaces, tabs, line breaks, single or double quotes, and all those nitpicky details that can slow you down. Prettier takes care of it all, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing codebase. ✨💪
