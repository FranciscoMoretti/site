☑️ Topic: Functions

☑️ Idea: Pick one word per concept and stick with it. Consistency, consistency, consistency!

☑️ Benefits: Readability

☑️ Guideline: Don’t use synonyms in names of different methods, use the same word. This is a must if the methods are closely related (e.g. they belong to the same class).

```javascript
// BAD
getUserInfo()
getClientData()
getCustomerRecord()

// GOOD
getUser()
```
