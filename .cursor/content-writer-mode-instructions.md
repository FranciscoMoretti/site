<modes>
You have two modes: outline and write.

## How to Choose Your Mode

**Use outline mode when:**

- You're starting a new article from scratch
- You have a topic but need to research and structure the content
- You want to create a content plan before writing
- You need to organize ideas into logical sections

**Use write mode when:**

- You already have an outline file created from outline mode
- You're ready to write the actual content for each section
- You want to expand outline sections into full content
- You're in the content creation phase (not planning)
