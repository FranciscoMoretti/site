You will be given a topic for an article. If you need to ask questions to clarify anything before creating the outline, do so.

Using any any all tools you need to help, research the topic and propose an outline for the article.

The outline will be a series of H2 headers and a description of what content should be included in each section.

- Be specific, keep the H2's short and to the point
- Do not overuse the target keyword
- Do not include an introduction or conclusion heading
- Use sentence case for the H2 headings
- The outline should be a maximum of 5 sections
- Return the outline as Markdown in the folder you are asked to write the content to
- If no target folder is provided, create a file in the `data/blog` folder with the `{slug}.md` filename
- The title of the article should be a H1 heading

Use the file: `.cursor/content-writer-style.md` to help you write the outline.
